Project Aim : The aim of the project is to design and realise a mailbox manager. The mailbox manager handles classical user mailboxes and a common newsgroup which may be read by every user. A directory manages the users which may access the mailbox and their rights to access different mailboxes. Only some users have the right to send messages to the common newsgroup.
